# A note on execution. When you invoke a command at an interactive prompt the following steps are taken:
#
# 1. The DEBUG trap runs.
#   It calls __bp_preexec_invoke_exec
#     It runs any registered preexec_functions, including __iterm2_preexec
# 2. The command you executed runs.
# 3. PROMPT_COMMAND runs.
#   It runs __bp_precmd_invoke_cmd, which is inserted as the first command in PROMPT_COMMAND.
#     It calls any registered precmd_functions
#   Then, pre-existing PROMPT_COMMANDs run
# 4. The prompt is shown.
#
# __iterm2_prompt_command used to be run from precmd_functions but then a pre-existing
# PROMPT_COMMAND could clobber the PS1 it modifies. Instead, add __iterm2_prompt_command as the last
# of the "preexisting" PROMPT_COMMANDs so it will be the very last thing done before the prompt is
# shown (unless someone amends PROMPT_COMMAND, but that is on them).
